## Features
- Adds a new Rubber Tree to the World, that you can find
- This tree can be cut down, and made into Planks, Stairs and Slabs
- some Stuff can be made from it too
- You can craft the treetap, a block, that can be attached to rubber trees to harvest their resource: rubber resin
- the rubber resin then can be put in the furnace, and made into different things
- one of these things are the rubber boots: they reduce the amount of fall damage you receive by 60%
- another use is making a rubber block out of it. This block acts like a trampoline and also negates fall damage completely

## Notes
- it is a mod designed to run with MineClone2, and extends it's gameplay
- if you want to make sure, that your mod is compatible with this one, you can just use *group:rubber* in your crafting recipes for one piece of rubber.
- it also uses an internal library, that will be split of eventually, but for now it's part of it; One less dependency to worry about for you.

## Usage
- you can download the zip file from here, and then just unpack it into your mods folder. In your mods folder now should be a folder called mcl-rubber (potentially rename it to mcl_rubber, because i don't know it it will just work)
- alternatively you can also just find it on ContentDB for Minetest


Have fun and enjoy!
